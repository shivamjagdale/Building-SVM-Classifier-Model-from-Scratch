# Building-SVM-Classifier-Model-from-Scratch
Here we are building SVM Classifier Model from scratch for Machine Learning

Here I'm going to build an sum classifier model.
I will implement this model later in an example to show that it works.

SVM is classification model and kinda different from other models like Logistic and Linear Regression
Here we also have to follow 2 conditions when applying gradient descent
